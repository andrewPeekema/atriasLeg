# ATRIAS Leg Simulation
Clone both of these using gihub desktop,
open atriasleg main. 
add Matlablibaries and sub folders to path and atris leg, then press run. 


This code uses MATLAB to simulate the time response of one leg of ATRIAS.  It
uses several MATLAB libraries (on GitHub), which need to be downloaded and
added to the MATLAB path before this code will function.  The code can be
understood by reading the main.m file.
Clone both of these using gihub desktop,
open atriasleg main. 
add Matlablibaries and sub folders to path and atris leg, then press run.
